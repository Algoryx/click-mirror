0.1.34
- Add terminate() to Client and documentation for when "WSASTARTUP not yet performed" assertion occurs.
- Add --addr flag to ClickApplication to enable using ipc or different port than default one(5555). 

0.1.33
- Add retrieval of simulated time to SensorMessage API

0.1.32
- Implemented support for multiple input signal values, i.e. Torque in one joint and Angles on another.
- Deprecation warning on use of Control Type per scene in favor of Control Type per joint (C++ and python)
- Deprecation warning on use of withAngles(), withAngleVelocities() and withTorques() in favor of withValues() (C++)

0.1.31
- DemoServer reacts to Ctrl-Break.

0.1.30
- Require AGXBrick 0.5.7 or later
- agxClick support Brick.Signals ComponentBoolInput and ComponentBoolOutput

0.1.29
- Require AGXBrick 0.5.4 or later.
- agxClick support Brick.Signals RotatingBodyAngleOutput, RotatingBodyVelocityOutput and FixedVelocityEngineTorqueOutput.
- Client input events come in to agxClick as early as possible.
- agxClick output events come in as late as possible.

0.1.28
- Add controlType retrieval to C++ HandshakeMessage API
- When the ResetBatchListener is used, a reset call will also step to the next batch configuration

0.1.27
- Add compatibility with AGX versions where ExampleApplication does not support websockets.

0.1.26
- Reset from Keybaord will send ResetMessage immediately if possible to prevent recv fail
- --batch <seconds> will restart simulation from the initial position(s) continously. See agxClick/README.md.

0.1.25
- Bugfix: Sends ResetMessage before SimulationStep, i.e. fixes the "bug" that stepped once between Reset and sending ResetMessage
- Aborts Reset on HandshakeInit, so that reattached controllers does not get ResetMessage as first reply to HandshakeInit
- Bugfix: Handshake now sends TorqueSensor as Torque Valuetype

0.1.24
- Implemented separate simulation and graphics frequency to improve performance in agxViewer. Enable with --framerate
- Added performance and profiling sections to agxClick README.

0.1.23
- Enabled profiling with --profile
- Minor performance increase (3%)
- Fix bug that updates robots btw reset and resetmessage to solve reset problem with --disableClickSync

0.1.22
- Support for multiple arms in one robot.
- Bugfix example application wrt absolute windows paths to model
- Add --disableClickSync which disables control message sync

0.1.21
- Fix Remove uncached Brick import

0.1.20
- C++ API supports SimulationSettings in HandshakeMessage

0.1.19
- agxClick supports grouping several signals into one sensor if they have the same protocolReference.

0.1.18
- agxClick support Brick.Physics.DriveTrain Signals.
- Minimum version of agxBrick required is 0.4.68.

0.1.17
- agxClick uses Sensor name as Click identifier, see agxClick/README.md

0.1.16
- agxClick finds one JointForce3DSensor and one JointTorque3DSensor per robot, and adds them to HandshakeMessage and SensorMessage
